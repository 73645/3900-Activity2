# UNO University Website Demo

This is my first website, developed using HTML and CSS. Within this website, I've crafted pages for a university homepage, an about page, a course page, and a students page. This project marks my first assignment in the field of web application development.

1. **Accessing the Website:**

   You can access the website by visiting [University of Nebraska, Omaha](https://73645.github.io/TestRepo/).

2. **Interacting with the Website:**

  You can click on the link above to visit the website, where you will find pages for the home, about, courses, and students. Clicking on any of these pages will direct you to the respective section. This website provides information about the courses and students at the University of Nebraska.

3. **Interesting Fact**

   If you click on the website link and navigate to the home, about, student, or course buttons, you'll notice a vertical red line. I found this design element interesting and incorporated it into my website. Additionally, if you visit the "Know More" icon option on our homepage, you'll see that it turns red when activated. I found this interactive feature captivating and decided to include it in my website's design.
